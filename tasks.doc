 * Here's the next task: Build a simple calendar service. 
 * The service should have the following functionality:
 * 1. When an admin asks for "get free slots", the service will respond with a list of three free time slots in the next three business days. 
 * Business days are Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm.
 * If I ask for a time slot on Friday evening, the service should respond with the next available time slot on Monday.
 * 2. When an admin says "add an event "call with <name>" at day/time, the service should respond with "ok, I've added "call with <name> at <day/time>" and add it to the calendar.
 * 3. When an admin says "get my schedule", the service should respond with a list of all events for the week based on the list of events in the calendar. 
 * 4. When an admin says "cancel <this event> at <day/time>", the service should respond with "ok, I've cancelled the event at <day/time>" and remove it from the calendar.
